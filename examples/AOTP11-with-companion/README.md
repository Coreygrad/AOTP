# @AOTP11/companion example

This is a simple, lean example that combines the usage of @AOTP11/companion and AOTP11 client.

## AOTP11 it

To run this example, make sure you've correctly installed the **repository root**:

```bash
corepack yarn install
corepack yarn build
```

That will also install the dependencies for this example.

Then, again in the **repository root**, start this example by doing:

```bash
corepack yarn workspace @AOTP11-example/AOTP11-with-companion start
```
